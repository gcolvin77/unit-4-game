Lego LOTR Battle Royale

You must first choose a character to play. Once chosen, you will then be
tasked with fighting the remaining characters in any order you choose.

Once you choose an enemy, you will see your health as well as theirs. Click
attack to inflict damage, but be careful as all enemies will counter.

If you run out of health at any time, you have lost!  You must defeat all 
enemies to get a victory. Your attack power increases with each attack,
and will not reset upon choosing another enemy.

Hint: find enemies with low counter values and attack them first.

Good Luck!
